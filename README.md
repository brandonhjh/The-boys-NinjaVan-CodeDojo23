## Problem Statement
In warehouses that rely on manual labour for sorting, during peak periods there is a large volume of both workers and packages. This in combination with bad visibility of package movement causes the manager to rely on his perception of where the choke points are. 

## Project Description:
### Solution
> Creating an updated Dashboard to improve visualbility of package load in the warehouse to enable efficient manpower allocations

### MVP
> Provide a quick glance dashboard that shows the number/percentage of packages at which point they are scanned
