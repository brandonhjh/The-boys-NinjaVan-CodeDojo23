## Problem Statement
In warehouses that rely on manual labour for sorting, there are a large volume of both workers and parcels during peak periods. Subobtimal manpower allocation due to poor visibility of parcels and worker movement will lead to increased workload for workers and slower parcel processing rate.

## Project Description:
### Solution
> Creating a real-time Intellegent Visualisation Tool to improve visilbility of parcel load and worker's movements to enable efficient manpower allocation during peak periods.

### MVP
> A high-powered quick-glance Intellegent Visualisation Tool that shows real-time the number of parcels being processed, proportion of packages that is sorted at different zones in the warehouse, and the number of workers working at the different zones.
